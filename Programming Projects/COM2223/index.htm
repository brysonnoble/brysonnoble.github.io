                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="content">Attention deficit disorders (ADD), including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affect a wide array of people. ADHD is defined as a mental condition characterized by persistent difficulty in maintaining attention and concentration, with a degree of impulsive and hyperactive behavior (ADHD, 2023) and was first documented in the late 18th century (Pharm, 2018). While ADDs cannot be cured, a wide variety of medications is available to treat symptoms. Additional symptoms attributed to those who have ADD also include inattentiveness and compulsive behavior. In children and adolescents, other mental issues and behaviors accompany ADDs, such as anxiety, depression, learning disorders, and negative and disruptive attitudes toward authority figures like parents and teachers (ADHD Symptoms, 2021). Those in educational institutions who suffer from ADDs have been reported to perform worse than their unafflicted peers in reading comprehension, math, and other science-based classes, including having lower grade-point averages and an increased likeliness of repeating grade levels, regardless of socioeconomic factors (Jangmo et al., 2019). ADHD also causes issues for employed adults, who may suffer from distractibility, procrastination, and poor management of complex projects and actions, all of which negatively affect workplace performance and productivity. In 2022, a million more children have been diagnosed than in 2016, prompting concern about the rise and prevalence of ADHD and similar attention deficit disorders in children (Danielson et al., 2024).</p>
                <p class="content">Our group, composed of four students from various academic backgrounds from the Florida Institute of Technology, compared scholarly research articles and a focus group survey. We have examined and compared the screening and diagnosis methods, trends and numbers of diagnoses, and the treatment of ADHD.</p>

                <h2>Comparative Analysis of ADHD</h2>
                <h3>Demographic Breakdown of ADHD Diagnosis</h3>
                <p class="content">Around 9% of all children have ADHD (Danielson et al., 2018). Rosenthal et al. (2024) aim to quantify a differential item on functioning ADHD to assess the demographic breakdown of children with ADHD. Factors that are tested include age, gender, and cultural norms that parents or teachers assume. This study utilized a consistent questionnaire, and the setting in which the participants are tested remains constant. Trends that were found lead to indications that male children are generally rated as having more ADHD symptoms than female children. Younger children tend to have higher levels of ADHD than older children, and patterns reflect teachers rating black children as having a higher level of ADHD than white children. Refer to Figure 1 for the correlation of Other Conditions with ADHD by Sex.</p>

                <h3>Screen Time and ADHD Symptoms</h3>
                <p class="content">A common talking point regarding factors that may make individuals more likely to show signs of ADHD is the conditions they were exposed to during early childhood development. Hundreds of studies have been done regarding all of the different possible ways that the early developing brain of a child could be affected by specific circumstances and factors. In fact, researchers from the National Library of Medicine sought to discover if there was any link between the conditions of development during childhood and developing ADHD later in life, performing a meta-analysis on 70 different individual studies researching the topic. These studies had over 4 million participants from diverse backgrounds, all eventually leading the researchers to conclude that there was “critical evidence” showing that childhood experiences can affect brain development and potentially cause ADD/ADHD symptoms later in life (Zhang, 2022).</p>
                <p class="content">It is worth noting that the study and the studies that were analyzed by the researchers were primarily focused on the much more serious and complicated side of childhood surroundings and experiences, being focused more on the abuse and trauma aspect; however, the conclusion that exposure to certain phenomena during early brain development can lead to a higher risk of ADHD is still entirely relevant to the discussion. It becomes clearer why screen time exposure and ADHD in children are being looked at as a more glaring issue, with reports of 95% of children ages 13–17 having access to a cellular device and access to social media, and 40% of children ages 8–12 reported to have the same access in 2022 as per the National Library of Medicine.</p>
                <p class="content">The idea of screen time having the potential to exacerbate ADHD symptoms is a relatively new topic due to the overwhelming advancements made in cellular technology over the past 20 years. However, since the topic is new, the true effects of screen time on the minds of children cannot be given a 100% certain conclusion, as simply not enough time has passed for research to show the big picture. That said, research has been actively conducted that does show decent significance in regard to ADHD research. Researchers Ambarish Ghosh, Maidul Islam, and Raghav Oza for the Asian Journal of Medical Sciences decided to analyze all available research done between ADHD and screen time in a meta-analysis to truly determine if there is any substantial link between the two. After analyzing over 15 different studies conducted, the researchers found very interesting trends. The relationship between screen time and ADHD symptoms was considered very complicated. However, some research showed a very strong link between the two, with others coming back inconclusive. Despite there being clear signs of a link between screen time and ADHD, more research must be conducted to be certain. It can be reasonably stated that higher screen time does increase the risks for developing minds.</p>
                <h3>Diagnosis and Overdiagnosis</h3>
                <p class="content">A key point in discussing the rise of attention deficit disorders in children is to explore whether medical professionals are overdiagnosing these disorders or if they are simply doing a better job at recognizing the symptoms. In only 20 years, national population surveys show an increase in the prevalence of ADHD, increasing from 6.1% in 1997 to 10.2% in 2016 (Racine et al., 2021). Comparing these pre-COVID numbers to our data collected from a sample of students at the Florida Institute of Technology, we observe another massive increase in diagnoses, with 25.9% of students indicating that they have been diagnosed with either ADHD or ADD (see Figure 2 below).</p>

                <p><i>Note.</i> Data collected from a sample of 81 students at Florida Institute of Technology, 2024.</p>
                <p class="content">Of course, our group found  that the sample size was small, but the 16.4% difference between our numbers and those measured in 2016 are too significant considering sampling errors.</p>
                <p class="content">To make sense of the data, the history of ADHD was to be considered.  To understand the diagnosis and definition of the disorder is important. Two significant reasons why ADHD diagnoses have increased dramatically more recently are because of the broadening of ADHD diagnostically and increased awareness of physicians and the public. The earliest account of ADHD is recorded in the book “On Attention and its Diseases” by Sir Alexander Crichton, in which he described “‘morbid alterations’ of attention that ‘render [individuals] incapable of attending with constancy to any one object of education” (qtd. in Abdelnour et al., 2022). Although Sir Crichton identified and recorded the disorder as early as the 18th century, ADHD was not globally recognized or treated until 1968, when it “made its first appearance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” (DSM). The disorder was known as “Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood” and did not earn the name “Attention Deficit Disorder,” or ADD, until the publication of DSM-III in 1980. This publication also included a list of symptoms to diagnose ADD, whereas previously, the disorder was noted to have unclear parameters for diagnosis. The parameters for diagnosing ADD and ADHD continued to evolve in subsequent publications of the DSM, which allowed for the diagnosis in more people with milder symptoms. For example, in DSM-IV, ADHD could be diagnosed by “evidence of impairment in 2 or more settings,” while in DSM-V, ADHD could be diagnosed by “evidence of symptoms in 2 or more settings” (Abdelnour et al., 2022). Other changes between the two publications are outlined in Figure 3.</p>

                <p><i>Note.</i> Abdelnour et al., 2022.</p>
                <p class="content">We observe a similar theme of diagnosis broadening throughout the time leading up to the present day, which plays a key role in the increase of ADHD and ADD diagnoses. Although Sir Crichton recorded the first form of ADD over 225 years ago, ADD is still a very new disease and has been evolving rapidly over recent years. ADHD and ADD are unique diseases because they are only indicated by behavioral observations, biomarkers cannot be employed for further evaluation. (Abdelnour et al., 2022). The lack of solid criteria makes it difficult classify the disease and draw clear boundaries to whether an individual should be diagnosed with the disease, leaving much up to the clinician's interpretation.</p>
                <p class="content">Symptoms of ADHD and ADD heavily overlap with symptoms of other mental disorders, such as anxiety or depression, which have increased drastically following the COVID-19 pandemic. Shown in Figure 4:</p>
                <b>Figure 4</b>
                <p>Other Concerns and Conditions with ADHD by Age</p>
                <img src="https://brysonnoble.github.io/Programming%20Projects/COM2223/Images/Figure1.png">
                <p><i>Note.</i> CDC, 2024.</p>
                <p class="content">Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of the youth population affected by anxiety was approximately 11.6%, and the percentage of the youth population affected by depression was approximately 12.9% (Racine et al., 2021). These numbers have increased significantly following the pandemic, with the same study citing increases in anxiety among the youth population as low as 2.2% and as high as 63.8%. Similarly, increases in depression among the youth population were observed to have grown from as low as 1.8% to as high as 49.5% (Racine et al., 2021). Regardless of which study has the most accurate data, there has been an apparent increase in diagnoses of anxiety and depression in the youth population following COVID-19, which directly led to an increase in ADHD and ADD diagnoses. Without clear criteria on how to diagnose ADHD and ADD and effectively separate them from disorders such as anxiety or depression, it is hard to say whether ADHD and ADD are being overdiagnosed, especially with the disorder’s ever-changing definition and diagnosis requirements. Until health professionals establish a more stable definition and set of symptoms for ADHD and ADD, it will be impossible to say with certainty that the disease is being over or under-diagnosed. What is clear, however, is that diagnoses for these disorders are on the rise and will continue to trend up if the diagnosis broadening continues as it has for almost half a century.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY8UljMhmyQ&ab_channel=MedicatingNorma" target="_blank">Conclusion</a></h2>
                <p class="content">ADHD has become more widely recognized and understood by both the public and medical community. Teachers, parents, and healthcare providers are more aware of ADHD symptoms and are therefore more likely to recommend evaluations for children and even adults who might have been undiagnosed in the past. Over the years, diagnostic criteria for ADHD have also evolved. Broader definitions and criteria allow for a wider range of behaviors to be classified as ADHD, which may increase the number of diagnoses. The DSM-V, for instance, has expanded the criteria to include presentations that are less severe than those previously considered, allowing more individuals, especially adults, to meet the criteria (DSM. [n.d.]). Mental health professionals are more accessible by telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to further facilitated evaluations for ADHD. Lastly, the marketing and availability of ADHD medications, particularly in the U.S., can contribute to the rise in diagnosis. Pharmaceutical companies have marketed ADHD medications extensively, making both patients and parents more aware of medication options and potentially prompting more individuals to seek a diagnosis to assess these treatments. Some argue that ADHD may be overdiagnosed, particularly in children. In some cases, behaviors that are normal for a child’s developmental stage, such as an increase in screen time, are labeled as ADHD. This concern often stems from a combination of pressure to perform academically and an eagerness to medicate behaviors that might otherwise be managed with behavioral interventions. The increase in ADHD diagnoses likely reflects a combination of genuine needs, better diagnostic tools, cultural shifts, and the influence of medication availability. This combination of factors means more people are aware of and able to access ADHD diagnosis and treatment than ever before.</p>
