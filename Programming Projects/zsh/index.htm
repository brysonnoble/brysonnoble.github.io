      <h1>Oh My Zsh Smirnoff Theme</h1>
      <p>I created this theme as a quick and fun side project while working on the final project for one of my classes. The theme was inspired by and named after the Smirnoff drink, and actually ended up looking quite nice. The demo above is just a quick web-based simulation of what it looks like to run in terminal, but the code for the theme is below.</p>
