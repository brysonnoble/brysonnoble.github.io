            <h2>Comparative Analysis of ADHD</h2>
            <h3>Demographic Breakdown of ADHD Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>Around 9% of all children have ADHD (Danielson et al., 2018). Rosenthal et al. (2024) aim to quantify a differential item on functioning ADHD to assess the demographic breakdown of children with ADHD. Factors that are tested include age, gender, and cultural norms that parents or teachers assume. This study utilized a consistent questionnaire, and the setting in which the participants are tested remains constant. Trends that were found lead to indications that male children are generally rated as having more ADHD symptoms than female children. Younger children tend to have higher levels of ADHD than older children, and patterns reflect teachers rating black children as having a higher level of ADHD than white children. An estimated 6.0% of U.S. adults have a current diagnosis of ADHD, totaling approximately 15.5 million individuals (General Prevalence, [n.d.]). Among children ranging from 5–17 years, non-Hispanic white children have a higher prevalence of 13.4% compared to non-Hispanic black 10.8% and Hispanic children of 8.9% are diagnosed with ADHD (CDC, 2024). The statistics suggest that cultural differences arise at different levels of diagnoses across various demographics. However, a large number of the population has been diagnosed with ADHD.</p>

            <h3>Diagnosis and Overdiagnosis</h3>
            <p>A key point in discussing the rise of attention deficit disorders in children is to explore whether medical professionals are overdiagnosing these disorders or if they are simply doing a better job at recognizing the symptoms. In only 20 years, national population surveys show an increase in the prevalence of ADHD, increasing from 6.1% in 1997 to 10.2% in 2016 (Racine et al., 2021.). Comparing these pre-COVID numbers to our data collected from a sample of students at the Florida Institute of Technology, we observe another massive increase in diagnoses, with 25.9% of students indicating that they have been diagnosed with either ADHD or ADD (see Figure 3 below).</p>

            <i>Diagnosis of ADHD Within the Student Body at Florida Institute of Technology</i>
            <p>Of course, we must take this number with a grain of salt, given that the sample size is small, but the 16.4% difference between our numbers and those measured in 2016 seems too significant to chalk up to sampling errors.<br>To put these numbers into perspective, the history of ADHD is to be considered. It is important to understand how the disorder is diagnosed, and how the definition of the disorder has changed over time. Two significant reasons why ADHD diagnoses have increased dramatically more recently are because of the broadening of ADHD diagnostically and increased awareness of physicians and the public (Abdelnour et al., 2022.). According to the study by Abdelnour, Jansen, and Gold, the earliest account of ADHD is recorded in the book “On Attention and its Diseases” by Sir Alexander Crichton, in which he described “‘morbid alterations’ of attention that ‘render [individuals] incapable of attending with constancy to any one object of education’.” Although Sir Chrichton identified and recorded the disorder as early as the 18th century, ADHD was not globally recognized or treated until 1968, when it “made its first appearance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,” or DSM for short. The disorder was known as “Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood” and did not earn the name “Attention Deficit Disorder,” or ADD, until the publication of DSM-III in 1980. This publication also included a list of symptoms to diagnose ADD, whereas previously, the disorder was noted to have unclear parameters for diagnosis. The parameters for diagnosing ADD and ADHD continued to evolve in subsequent publications of the DSM, which allowed for the diagnosis in more people with milder symptoms. For example, in DSM-IV, ADHD could be diagnosed by “evidence of impairment in 2 or more settings,” while in DSM-V, ADHD could be diagnosed by “evidence of symptoms in 2 or more settings” (Abdelnour et al., 2022.). Other changes between the two publications are outlined in Figure 4 below.</p>

Note. From Changes in diagnostic determination for ADHD between the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV and V editions. Data from ADHD Diagnostic Trends Over Time. Data from Abdelnour, Elie, et al. 2022.
 We observe a similar theme of diagnosis broadening throughout the time leading up to the present day, which plays a key role in the increase of ADHD and ADD diagnoses. Although Sir Crichton recorded the first form of ADD over 225 years ago, ADD is still a very new disease and has been evolving rapidly over recent years. ADHD and ADD are unique diseases because they are only indicated by behavioral observations, biomarkers cannot be employed for further evaluation. (Abdelnour et al., 2022.). The lack of solid criteria makes it difficult classify the disease and draw clear boundaries to whether an individual should be diagnosed with the disease, leaving much up to the clinician's interpretation.
Symptoms of ADHD and ADD heavily overlap with symptoms of other mental disorders, such as anxiety or depression, which have increased drastically following the COVID-19 pandemic. Shown in Figure 1

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of the youth population affected by anxiety was approximately 11.6%, and the percentage of the youth population affected by depression was approximately 12.9% (Racine et al., 2021.). These numbers have increased significantly following the pandemic, with the same study citing increases in anxiety among the youth population as low as 2.2% and as high as 63.8%. Similarly, increases in depression among the youth population were observed to have grown from as low as 1.8% to as high as 49.5% (Racine et al., 2021.). Regardless of which study has the most accurate data, there has been an apparent increase in diagnoses of anxiety and depression in the youth population following COVID-19, which directly led to an increase in ADHD and ADD diagnoses. Without clear criteria on how to diagnose ADHD and ADD and effectively separate them from disorders such as anxiety or depression, it is hard to say whether ADHD and ADD are being overdiagnosed, especially with the disorder’s ever-changing definition and diagnosis requirements. Until health professionals establish a more stable definition and set of symptoms for ADHD and ADD, it will be impossible to say with certainty that the disease is being over or under-diagnosed. What is clear, however, is that diagnoses for these disorders are on the rise and will continue to trend up if the diagnosis broadening continues as it has for almost half a century.
